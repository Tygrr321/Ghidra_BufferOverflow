# Ghidra_BufferOverflow
This repository is intended to develop a basic application that is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack (with NOP Instruction/sled) to use as a demo in a class. 

Please feel free to create and add to parts of this repository to help create a working demo project for students to learn!

Notes on how to run the application and to demo the project are appreciated!
